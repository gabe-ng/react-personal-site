# Personal Website

This repository holds the code for my personal website. View the website [live](https://gabe-ng.github.io/).

## Motivation

I wanted to create a page that could showcase what I know, what I've done, and a little about who I am and what I like. This is only the first version and will be consistently updated as I learn more things and build more stuff.

## Technology Used

This site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).

Thanks for stopping by!
